# Sibling: poster design experiment

![screenshot preview](sibling-screenshot.png)

Goofing around to solve a challenge posed to Eric Meyer in a [2018 episode of ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/331-think-like-front-end-developer-eric-meyer/#t=1:03:18) about how to build [this poster design](https://dribbble.com/shots/4858587-Sibling) by Steve Wolf as a front-end webpage.

Uses:

- CSS Grid
- Flexbox just for centering
- sideways text using `writing-mode` and `transform`
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- `-webkit-text-stroke` for letter outlines
- embedded SVG background pattern using a data URL
- a couple pseudo-elements

Done in a single sitting so code is sloppy. Layout is desktop only, big whoop.

Verified consistent in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on Mac, and MS Edge on Windows. Doesn't work on any version of IE.

Woo! Fun experiment.
